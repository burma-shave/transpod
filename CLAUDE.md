# Podcast Feed Transformer Memory

## URL Replacement Requirements

When transforming podcast feeds there is an atom:link element that needs to be updated with the transformed feed URL.

1. **atom:link element** (line 26 in reference):
   ```xml
   <atom:link href="https://feeds.wgbh.org/2469/feed-rss.xml" rel="self" type="application/rss+xml"/>
   ```
   - This should point to the transformed feed URL
   - Located in the channel metadata section


## Current Status
- Migrated from SAX parser to XSLT transformation approach
- XML escaping handled automatically by XSLT processor
- URL replacement functionality implemented via XSLT parameters

## Development Commands
- `npm run start` - Start the service

## Future Work
- Handle rdf:RDF and atom:feed structured feeds
